# Wellness tourism

### 1. Emerging Global Megatrend:
- Wellness tourism is rapidly growing as a global megatrend, drawing increasing attention from both the Korean governments and markets
- In 2023, the global wellness economy reached $6.3 trillion and is projected to approach $9 trillion by 2028.

### 2. Domestic Challenges:
- Although public interest in wellness-related keywords is high in Korea, this has not translated into a significant rise in actual tourist numbers.
- Official designation as a wellness tourism site boosts visibility, but has limited impact on sustained visitor growth and local ecosystem development.

### 3. Need for strategic shift:
- Current strategies are largely domestically focused; there is a pressing need to pivot toward attracting international visitors and supporting long-term ecosystem sustainability.

### 4. Importance of data-driven approaches:
- To identify the key conditions for successful wellness tourism settlement, this study employs an integrated analysis of data from the Korea Tourism Data Lab and other public sources.

### 5. Objective
- The goal is to enhance the effectiveness of existing policies and provide an evidence-based strategy model to help governments achieve greater success in wellness tourism development.
